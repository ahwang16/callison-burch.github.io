I am the Aravind K Joshi Term Assistant Professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests include statistical machine translation, data-driven paraphrasing, and crowdsourcing.

I will serve as the General Chair for ACL 2017, which will be held in Vancouver, Canada from July 30 - August 4, 2017. I am the Secretary-Treasurer for SIGDAT, which organizes the EMNLP conferences. I was the Program Co-Chair for EMNLP 2015. I am an action editor for the new journal Transactions of the ACL ([TACL](http://www.transacl.org)). I recently finished my terms on the editorial board of Computational Linguistics, and as the Chair of the NAACL Executive Board. In 2014, I was named a Sloan Research Fellow. 

My research group released [PPDB, the paraphrase database](http://paraphrase.org/), a resource with 169 million paraphrase transformation rules.

We developed [Joshua, an open source decoder for statistical machine translation](http://joshua-decoder.org/), which uses synchronous context free grammars, and extracts linguistically informed translation rules. 

I will be going up for tenure in the Fall. If you would like to read my materials, here they are:
