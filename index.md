I am the Aravind K Joshi Term Assistant Professor in the Computer and Information Sciences Department at the University of Pennsylvania. I joined the department in the Fall of 2013. My research interests include statistical machine translation, data-driven paraphrasing, and crowdsourcing.

In 2014 I was named a Sloan Research Fellow. [Here is a press release](http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/three-penn-researchers-awarded-sloan-fellowships) from Penn about my research and the research of the two other Penn faculty members who received the award.

I am the program co-chair for [EMNLP 2015](http://www.emnlp2015.org) in Lisbon. I am an action editor for the new journal Transactions of the ACL ([TACL](http://www.transacl.org)). I recently finished my terms on the editorial board of Computational Linguistics, and as the Chair of the NAACL Executive Board.

My research group released [PPDB, the paraphrase database](http://paraphrase.org/), a resource with 169 million paraphrase transformation rules.

We developed [Joshua, an open source decoder for statistical machine translation](http://joshua-decoder.org/), which uses synchronous context free grammars, and extracts linguistically informed translation rules.
