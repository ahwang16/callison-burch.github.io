I am an associate professor of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania.  Before joining Penn, I was a research faculty member at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University for 6 years. I was the Chair of the Executive Board of the North American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) from 2011-2013.  I have served on the editorial boards of the journals Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and Computational Linguistics.  I served as the General Chair of the ACL 2017 conference, and the Program Co-Chair for the EMNLP 2015 conference. I have more than 100 publications, which have been cited over 10,000 times.  I am a Sloan Research Fellow, and I have received faculty research awards from Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook in addition to funding from DARPA and the NSF.  My research interests include natural language processing and crowdsourcing. 

I got tenure in June of 2017. Yay! If you would like to read my materials, here they are:
