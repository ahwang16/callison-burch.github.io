I teach Penn's [Artifical Intelligence course](http://artificial-intelligence-class.org) (CIS 4210/5210) each Fall.  

In the Spring, I alternate teaching courses related to my research.  These include:
* CIS 5300 - [Computational Linguistics](http://computational-linguistics-class.org/lectures.html)
* CIS 7000 - [Interactive Fiction and Text Generation](https://interactive-fiction-class.org)
* NETS 2130 - [Crowdsourcing and Human Computation](http://crowdsourcing-class.org)
